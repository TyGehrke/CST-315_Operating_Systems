	to run commands in the terminal still.
	
2) Within VS Code, create a new C++ file named main.cpp and paste the main code into the file,
	then save the file.

4) You then can run your program by running this command in the terminal with: ./run

		+ This will read the data in "input1.txt" and "input2.txt" and produce 2 output "output1.txt" and "output2.txt"
